PyTextGame will be a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing text-only games. PyTextGame is a simple package meant to help people interested in software build the games of their dreams, free from having to worry about graphics. PyTextGame is built upon Pygame, which is in turn built upon the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) library.
